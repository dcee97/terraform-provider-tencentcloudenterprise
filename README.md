## üì¶ Requirements

Before using the software, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) version 1.5.x
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.13.x if you plan to build the provider plugin from source.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The provider requires some environment variables to work correctly. You need to set these up before running the application. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Use the following commands to set the required environment variables:

```bash
export TENCENTCLOUD_DOMAIN=api3.your-domain.com
export TENCENTCLOUD_PROTOCOL=HTTP
export TENCENTCLOUD_REGION=your-region

# Optional: To enable debug mode

Make sure to replace `api3.your-domain.com` and `your-region` with the appropriate values for your setup.

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src
