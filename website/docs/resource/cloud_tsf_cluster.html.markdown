# cloud_tsf_cluster

Provides a resource to create a tsf cluster

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "cloud_tsf_cluster" "cluster" {
  cluster_name  = "terraform-test"
  cluster_type  = "V"
  vpc_id        = "vpc-2l7uk2q1"
  cluster_desc  = "test"
  tsf_region_id = "chongqing"
  tags = {
    "createdBy" = "terraform"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cluster_name` - (Required, String) Cluster name.
* `cluster_type` - (Required, String) Cluster type. Valid values: `C`: Container cluster; `V`: Virtual machine cluster.
* `vpc_id` - (Required, String) Vpc id.
* `cluster_cidr` - (Optional, String) CIDR assigned to cluster containers and service IP.
* `cluster_desc` - (Optional, String) cluster notes.
* `cluster_remark_name` - (Optional, String) cluster remark name.
* `cluster_version` - (Optional, String) cluster version.
* `max_cluster_service_num` - (Optional, Int) The maximum number of services in the cluster. The value ranges from 32 to 32768. If it is not a power of 2, the nearest power of 2 will be taken up.
* `max_node_pod_num` - (Optional, Int) The maximum number of Pods on each Node in the cluster. The value ranges from 4 to 256. When the value is not a power of 2, the nearest power of 2 will be taken up.
* `program_id` - (Optional, String) The dataset ID to be bound.
* `subnet_id` - (Optional, String) Subnet id.
* `tags` - (Optional, Map) Tag description list.
* `tsf_region_id` - (Optional, String) The TSF region to which the cluster belongs.
* `tsf_zone_id` - (Optional, String) The TSF availability zone to which the cluster belongs.
